A project was created to demonstrate the use of Java Servlets.

Upon starting the server, a user can navigate to http://localhost:8080/Module-6-Servlet/Login, where a simple login form is available. The user can enter credentials, such that a GET request is sent to http://localhost:8080/Module-6-Servlet/Home. If the user enters the 'secret' password, the user is greeted by username. If the user does not enter the 'secret' password, the user is notified accordingly.
